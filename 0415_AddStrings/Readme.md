# 415. Add Strings

Given an array of n positive integers and a positive integer s, find the minimal length of a contiguous subarray of which the sum â‰¥ s. If there isn't one, return 0 instead.

>Note:

1. The length of both num1 and num2 is < 5100
2. Both num1 and num2 contains only digits 0-9
3. Both num1 and num2 does not contain any leading zero
4. You must not use any built-in BigInteger library or convert the inputs to integer directly.

**Example:**
    Input: num1 = "1", nums = "2"
